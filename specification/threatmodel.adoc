=== Adversary Model

_Unprivileged Software adversary -_ This includes software executing in 
U-mode managed by S/HS/M-mode system software. This adversary can access 
U-mode CSRs, process/task memory, CPU registers in the process context 
managed by system software.

_System Software adversary_ - This includes system software executing in 
S/HS/VS modes. Such an adversary can access S/HS/VS privileged CSRs, 
assigned system memory, CPU registers and IO devices.

_Startup Software adversary_ - This includes system software executing in 
early/boot phases of the system (in M-mode), including BIOS, memory 
configuration code, device option ROM/firmware that can access system 
memory, CPU registers, IO devices and IOMMU etc.

_Simple Hardware_ _adversary_ __ - This includes adversaries that can use 
hardware attacks such as bus interposers to snoop on memory/device 
interfaces, voltage/clock glitching, observe electromagnetic and other 
radiation, analyze power usage through instrumentation/tapping of power 
rails, etc. which may give the adversary the ability to tamper with data in 
memory.

_Advanced Hardware adversary_ - This includes adversaries that can use 
advanced hardware attacks, with unlimited physical access to the devices, 
and use mechanisms to tamper-with/reverse-engineer the hardware TCB e.g., 
extract keys from hardware, using capabilities such as scanning electron 
microscopes, fib attacks etc. 

_Side/Covert Channel Adversary_ - This includes adversaries that may 
leverage any explicit/implicit shared state (architectural or 
micro-architectural) to leak information across privilege boundaries via 
inference of characteristics from the shared resources (e.g. caches, branch 
prediction state, internal micro-architectural buffers, queues). Some 
attacks may require use of high-precision timers to leak information. A 
combination of system software and hardware adversarial approaches may be 
utilized by this adversary.

=== Threat Model

T1: Loss of confidentiality of TVMs and TSM memory via in-scope adversaries 
that may read TSM/TVM memory via CPU accesses

T2: Tamper/content-injection to TVM and TSM memory from in-scope 
adversaries that may modify TSM/TVM memory via CPU side accesses

T3: Tamper of TVM/TSM memory from in-scope adversaries via software-induced 
row-hammer attacks on memory

T4: Malicious injection of content into TSM/TVM execution context using 
physical memory aliasing attacks via system firmware adversary

T5: Information leakage of workload data via CPU registers, CSRs via 
in-scope adversaries

T6: Incorrect execution of workload via runtime modification of CPU 
registers, CSRs, mode switches via in-scope adversaries

T7: Invalid code execution or data injection/replacement via G-stage
paging remap attacks via system software adversary

T8: Malicious asynchronous interrupt injection or dropped leading to 
information leakage or incorrect execution of the TEE

T9: Malicious manipulation of time read from the virtualized time CSRs 
causing invalid execution of TVM workload

T10: Loss of Confidentiality via DMA access from devices under adversary 
control e.g. via manipulation of IOMMU programming

T11: Loss of Confidentiality from devices assigned to a TVM. Devices bound 
to a TVM must enforce similar properties as the TEE hosted on the platform.

T12: Content injection, exfiltration or replay (within and across TEE 
memory) via hardware approaches, including via exposed interface/links to 
other CPU sockets, memory and/or devices assigned to a TVM

T13: Downgrading TEE TCB elements (example TSM-driver, TSM) to older 
versions or loading Invalid TEE TCB elements on the platform to enable 
confidentiality, integrity attacks

T14: Leveraging transient execution side-channel attacks in TSM-driver, 
TSM, TVM, host OS/VMM or non-confidential workloads to leak confidential 
data e.g. via shared caches, branch predictor poisoning, page-faults.

T15: Leveraging architectural side-channel attacks due to shared cache and 
other shared resources e.g. via prime/probe, flush/reload approaches

T16: Malicious access to ciphertext with known plaintext to launch a 
dictionary attack on TVMs or TSM or trusted firmware to extract 
confidential data.

T17: Tamper of TVM state during migration of a TEE workload assets within 
the platform or from one platform to another. 

T18: Forging of attestation evidence and sealed data associated with a TVM.

T19: Stale TLB translations (for U/HS mode or for VU/VS) created during TSM 
or TVM operations are used to execute malicious code in the TVM (or consume 
stale/invalid data)

T20: Isolation of performance monitoring and/or debug state for a TVM 
leading to information loss via performance monitoring events/counters and 
debug mode accessible information.

T21: A TVM causes a denial of service on the platform

=== Scope

This specification does not prescribe the scope of mitigation and focusses 
on the TEEI interface and use-of/impact-on the RISC-V ISA. It is 
recommended that implementations of this reference architecture address 
threats from system software adversaries. Implementations may choose to 
mitigate threats from additional adversaries. For all cases, denial of 
service by TVMs must be prevented. At the same time, denial of service by 
host software is considered out of scope.
